# Framework Implementation

This directory contains a conceptual reimplementation of the evaluation framework used in our research. While the original code remains at Los Alamos National Laboratory, this implementation demonstrates the architecture and approach we used.

## Components

### Model Interface
The `model_interface.py` file implements the interface for interacting with different LLMs through a unified API. It handles prompt construction, response processing, and code extraction.

### Evaluation Engine
The `evaluation.py` file implements the core evaluation logic, including compilation testing, metric calculation, and the feedback mechanism.

### Framework Initialization
The `__init__.py` file defines the public API of the framework and handles component initialization.

## Conceptual Implementation

This is a simplified reimplementation meant to illustrate the approach rather than provide a full working system. Key aspects include:

1. **Model Abstraction**: Unified interface for different LLM APIs
2. **Compilation Testing**: Automated testing of generated C++ code
3. **Feedback Loop**: Implementation of the compiler error feedback system
4. **Metric Calculation**: Conceptual implementation of CodeBLEU and other metrics

## Usage Example

See the example at the bottom of the `framework.py` file for a demonstration of how the framework would be used to evaluate translations.

## Extending the Framework

If implementing a similar system, consider these extensions:
1. Add support for additional language pairs
2. Implement more sophisticated error analysis
3. Extend the feedback mechanism with learning capabilities
4. Add visualization components for result analysis
