   - Model comparison utilities

### Technology Stack

The framework was implemented using:
- **Python 3.10** as the primary programming language
- **Hugging Face Transformers** for model interface

   - Template selection based on task
   - Code embedding and formatting
   - Instruction clarity optimization

2. **Model Invocation**
   - Batch processing of translation requests
   - Response handling and error recovery
   - Timeout and retry mechanisms

3. **Output Processing**

   - Automatic formatting and normalization
   - Response validation

### Evaluation Process

1. **Metrics Calculation**
   - CodeBLEU computation against reference translations
   - AST generation and comparison
   - Data flow analysis

2. **Compilation Testing**
   - Automated build environment setup
   - Compiler invocation with standardized flags
   - Error capture and categorization

3. **Functional Testing**
   - Input-output equivalence testing
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Memory usage analysis

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Model API Consistency
**Problem**: Different models exposed inconsistent APIs and response formats.
**Solution**: Created a unified interface layer with model-specific adapters to standardize interactions.

### Challenge: Compiler Error Parsing
**Problem**: Compiler error messages varied in format and verbosity.
**Solution**: Developed a rule-based parser with regex patterns to extract structured information from GCC output.

### Challenge: Code Extraction Reliability
**Problem**: LLMs sometimes included explanations or partial code in responses.
**Solution**: Implemented robust code block detection with fallback strategies for ambiguous outputs.

### Challenge: Evaluation at Scale
**Problem**: Running thousands of translations and compilations efficiently.
**Solution**: Implemented parallel processing pipeline with result caching and failure recovery.

### Challenge: Memory Management Analysis
**Problem**: Evaluating memory management correctness was difficult.
**Solution**: Combined static analysis with runtime instrumentation to detect leaks and misuse patterns.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Model Deployment

For evaluation, models were deployed using:
- Hugging Face's Transformers library
- 8-bit quantization for larger models (34B parameter range)
- Batched inference where possible
- Hardware: NVIDIA A100 GPUs

Configuration parameters:
- Temperature: 0.2
- Top-p: 0.95
- Maximum new tokens: 2048
- Context window: Model dependent

### CodeBLEU Implementation

Our CodeBLEU implementation included:
- Custom tokenizers for Fortran and C++
- Tree-sitter for AST generation
- Graph-based data flow analysis
- Language-specific weighting adjustments

Key adaptations for Fortran-to-C++:
- Cross-language AST node mapping tables
- Fortran-to-C++ keyword correspondence dictionaries
- Syntax normalization for fair comparison

### Compiler Integration

Compilation testing pipeline:
- Docker-based isolated testing environments
- Standardized compiler flags for consistent evaluation
- Timeout mechanisms for non-terminating code
- Abstract interface for supporting multiple compilers

## Reproducibility Considerations

To ensure research reproducibility, we:
1. Fixed random seeds for all non-deterministic operations
2. Versioned all dependencies and environments
3. Maintained separate test and evaluation datasets
4. Documented all hyperparameters and configuration settings
5. Implemented automated logging of experimental conditions

## Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations improved framework performance:
- Response caching to avoid redundant model calls
- Parallel processing of independent translations
- Incremental evaluation to allow early stopping
- Memory-efficient implementation of CodeBLEU

## Limitations and Constraints

Implementation limitations to consider:
- Testing focused on self-contained Fortran code without external dependencies
- Maximum code size limited by model context windows
- Timeout constraints for compilation and execution
- Focus on scientific computing rather than all Fortran domains

## Future Implementation Directions

The framework could be extended with:
- Support for additional language pairs
- Integration with program synthesis techniques
- Learning-based error correction strategies
- Domain-specific translation optimization
- Multi-model ensemble translation methods

## Code Organization

The framework code was organized into the following modules:
- `models/` - Model interface implementations
- `metrics/` - Evaluation metric implementations
- `compilation/` - Compiler integration
- `feedback/` - Error analysis and prompt reformulation
- `visualization/` - Analysis and visualization tools
- `data/` - Test suite and dataset management
- `utils/` - Common utilities and helpers

## Usage Examples

Basic usage pattern:
```python
from framework import TranslationFramework, ModelRegistry

# Initialize framework
framework = TranslationFramework(
    models=ModelRegistry.load_models(['codellama', 'mixtral']),
    metrics=['codebleu', 'compilation_success'],
    feedback_enabled=True
)

# Run evaluation
results = framework.evaluate_test_suite('scientific_computing')

# Generate analysis
analysis = framework.analyze_results(results)
visualizations = framework.generate_visualizations(analysis)
```

This implementation provides a flexible, extensible platform for evaluating LLM-based code translation capabilities, with particular focus on Fortran-to-C++ translation for scientific computing applications.
