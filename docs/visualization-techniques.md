- Data available in machine-readable formats

## Key Insights Revealed

The visualization approach uncovered several significant findings:
- Clear clustering of translation strategies by model family lineage
- Identification of "error-prone" Fortran constructs across all models
- Diminishing returns in model size beyond 13B parameters for basic constructs
- Strong correlation between first-pass compilation rate and final translation quality
- Distinctive "learning patterns" in how models respond to compiler feedback

## Example Visualizations

The repository includes the following example visualizations:
- Model performance comparison radar charts
- Error category distribution by model
- Improvement trajectory across feedback iterations
- Translation consistency network visualization
- Interactive translation pair explorer

These visualizations formed a critical component of our analysis, enabling both quantitative assessment and qualitative understanding of model behavior in the Fortran-to-C++ translation task.
